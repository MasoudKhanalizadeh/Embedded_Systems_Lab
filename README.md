#Embedded Systems Lab

A curated collection of closed, skill-focused embedded projects built using ESP32, Arduino, and low-level C.
Each project is intentionally small, self-contained, and designed to strengthen:

Low-level C programming

Real-time event loops

Hardware–software integration

Debugging and logging skills

System-level thinking

IoT and microcontroller fundamentals

This lab is part of a long-term learning system designed to support my PhD preparation, systems research skills, and industry-ready DevOps/embedded engineering abilities.

📁 Projects
🔹 1. ESP32 DevOps Mini Monitor

Read sensors, display on OLED, and print system-style logs every 5 seconds.

👉 Folder: projects/esp32-devops-monitor/

🔹 2. Motion Indicator (PIR + RGB + OLED)

React to motion with RGB lighting and on-screen feedback.

👉 Folder: projects/motion-indicator/

🔹 3. Servo Mood Indicator

Servo changes “emotion” based on ambient light.

👉 Folder: projects/servo-mood-indicator/

📜 Project Philosophy

All projects are closed — no further extension.

Each one focuses on a single technical concept.

Built to avoid overload and create consistent progress.

Designed to balance creativity and systems-level skill building.
