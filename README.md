# Embedded Systems Lab

A curated collection of **closed**, skill-focused embedded projects built using **ESP32**, **Arduino**, and **low-level C**.  
Each project is intentionally small, self-contained, and designed to strengthen:

- Low-level C programming  
- Real-time event loops (millis-based)  
- Hardware–software integration  
- Debugging and serial logging  
- System-level thinking  
- IoT and microcontroller fundamentals  

This lab is part of a long-term personal system designed to support my **PhD preparation**, **systems research**, and **DevOps/embedded engineering** skillset.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 1. ESP32 DevOps Mini Monitor  
_Read temperature, humidity, and light; display on OLED; print system-style logs every 5 seconds._  
**Folder:** `projects/esp32-devops-monitor/`

---

### 🔹 2. Motion Indicator (PIR + RGB + OLED)  
_Reacts to motion with RGB lighting and on-screen feedback._  
**Folder:** `projects/motion-indicator/`

---

### 🔹 3. Servo Mood Indicator  
_Servo rotates to reflect "emotion" based on ambient light level._  
**Folder:** `projects/servo-mood-indicator/`

## 📜 Project Philosophy

- All projects are **closed** – no further extension or feature additions.  
- Each project targets **one core technical concept**.  
- Built to avoid overload and ensure consistent, focused learning.  
- Designed to balance creativity with **systems-level engineering**.
